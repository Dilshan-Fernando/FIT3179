        "Wildfires are detected through the use of satellite imagery obtained from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite). These satellite systems are capable of identifying thermal anomalies and alterations in landscape patterns, which are indicative of burning.",
